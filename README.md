## Features

- **Multi-tenancy** — complete data isolation per business via `tenantId` row-level filtering
- **Product variants** — single product with multiple SKUs (size/colour/storage/etc.)
- **Concurrency-safe stock** — atomic `findOneAndUpdate` with MongoDB `$elemMatch` guard; no race conditions
- **Smart low-stock alerts** — only alerts when pending POs won't cover the deficit (no false alarms)
- **Purchase Order workflow** — draft → sent → confirmed → (partially) received, with per-item receipt tracking
- **Sales Order workflow** — atomic stock deduction on creation; partial fulfillment tracking; stock released on cancellation
- **Audit trail** — append-only `StockMovement` log for every stock change
- **Real-time notifications** — Socket.io pushes `stock:low` events to all users in the tenant room
- **Dashboard analytics** — inventory value, 7-day movement chart, top-5 sellers, low-stock widget
- **RBAC** — owner / manager / staff role hierarchy
- **API documentation** — full OpenAPI 3.0 spec served via Swagger UI at `/api/docs`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnabbhakta791/inventory-management-system.git
cd inventory-management-system

# Install server deps
cd server && npm install

# Install client deps
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `server/.env`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/inventory-management
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Seed the database

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

This creates two isolated demo tenants with products, suppliers, purchase orders, sales orders, and stock movements.

### 4. Start servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API server (port 5000)
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — React client (port 5173)
cd client && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**

## API Documentation

Interactive Swagger UI is available once the server is running:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/docs
```

### How to authenticate in Swagger UI

1. Open `http://localhost:5000/api/docs`
2. Use **`POST /api/auth/login`** → click **Try it out** → enter a seed credential → **Execute**
3. Copy the `token` value from the response body
4. Click the **Authorize 🔒** button at the top of the page
5. Paste the token and click **Authorize** — all subsequent requests will include it automatically

> The token persists across page refreshes (`persistAuthorization: true`).

The spec covers all **34 endpoints** with full request/response schemas, role requirements, query parameters, and error response shapes (including the `409` insufficient-stock response with `sku`, `available`, and `requested` fields).

## Concurrency Test

```bash
cd server
npm run test:concurrency
```

Sets stock to 1 unit, fires 10 simultaneous POST `/api/orders` requests.  
**Expected:** exactly 1 success (HTTP 201) + 9 conflicts (HTTP 409).  
Confirms MongoDB atomic `$elemMatch` stock guard works correctly.

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** for detailed design decisions and trade-offs.
